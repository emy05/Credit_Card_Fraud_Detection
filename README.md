# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
This project is aimed at building a credit card fraud detection system using machine learning algorithms. 
The objective is to accurately detect fraudulent transactions and prevent financial losses for credit card companies and customers. The project uses the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle.
The project preprocesses the data and uses various machine learning algorithms, Random Forest, Decision Tree classifiers,LogisticRegression, KNeighborsClassifier, Support Vector Machines to build models for detecting fraudulent transactions. 
Based on the results, the Random Forest classifier is recommended for credit card fraud detection. The project is implemented in Python  and requires the pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries.
